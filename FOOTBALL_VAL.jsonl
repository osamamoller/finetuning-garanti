(Example: If the arrow points to 6, then 5 must be before and 7 after.)\n\nArrow Direction:\n\nDetermine which direction the arrow points (e.g., left, right, up, down).\n\nBased on the arrow's direction, read the digit on the side corresponding to that direction as the decade digit and the digit on the opposite side as the year digit.\n\nExample:\n\nIf the arrow points left, then the top digit is the decade and the bottom digit is the year.\n\nIf the arrow points right, then the left digit is the decade and the right digit is the year.\n\nAdjust accordingly for other orientations.\n\nCalculate Full Year:\n\nCombine the two digits to form the full year.\n\nExample: Decade digit 2 → 2020s, Year digit 3 → 2023, Result: 2023.\n\nValidation:\n\nRedo all previous steps without referring to your earlier work.\n\nEnsure that the outcome is consistent in two separate evaluations before finalizing.\n\nFinal Output Format:\n\nWrite the final answer exactly as follows:\n\nMonth YYYY (e.g., February 2023)\n\nYYYY-MM (e.g., 2023-02)\n\nExample Final Answer:\n\nArrow points to 2, with 1 before and 3 after → Confirmed February.\n\nArrow points left; top digit = 2, bottom digit = 3 → 2023.\n\nFinal Answer: 02/2023\n\nRemember: Only the final answer should be output.
